# Dictionary #

## Overview ##

This is a dictionary server I am making to learn under the tutelage of JART. Just download the client, and learn! From your terminal, even!

## Details ##

I plan on using the Oxford Dictionary.

## Usage ##

This will change as I get this program functioning...

    $ make
    $ ./echoserv 5000 &
    $ telnet localhost 5000
    $ hello
      // an English greeting
